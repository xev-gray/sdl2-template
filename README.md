# About

This is a free-to-use application template for games and softwares. It is written in C++ using SDL2 for a fast and powerful application.

# Usage

Clone the repository in your file system and edit its files according to the comments (check `main.cpp` for help), and compile your code using the Makefile afterwards using the `make all` or `make small` command.

# Notes

1. If you're on Windows or if you would like to run the Windows .exe using Wine on MacOS or Linux, you'll need to extract the `windows.tar.gz` archive to be able to compile and run the program.
2. The Makefile is configured to cross-compile from Unix-like systems to Windows, check its comments to know how.
3. There is an empty `Entity` class in the back-end files, you're free to do what you want with it.
4. If you have any question, issue or suggestion, feel free to reach out to me.
